  desc: The first week was mainly spent on browsing the projects to pick from Assessment 1. We picked Team32 after looking into it for several meetings. We set up testing for our game and investigated team 32’s possibility for testing. We also started our initial work on requirements this week.

  desc: "This week was heavily focused on finishing off the requirements. Work on testing started on Thursday. Most of the team members also spent some time exploring the codebase and relevant classes during the week which isn’t clearly reflected on the Gantt chart above."

  desc: "In the third week, we picked up the pace on testing and tried to involve more team members into it. We discussed changes we wanted to method selection and planning as a group.  A Risk Assessment document was created and worked on. Codebase exploration continued and Implementation work also began this week. New foods (Pizza & Jacket Potato) were added to the game. The basic implementation of Continuous Integration Pipeline was started and finished this week as well."

  desc: Some of the team members focused on testing while others tried to fix some tests that failed previously. A bug was found in the implementation of the Continuous Integration Pipeline where Multi OS tests wouldn’t continue if one test fails. It was fixed and dealt with during the week. Architecture and Method for changing was worked on this week. We investigated box2d and tried to get some work done.

  desc: Testing and implementation were the big parts of the week and we also worked on some documentations. A few team members were working on testing the Station and Customer Manager classes. We started implementing the scenario mode in the game. We received feedback on team32’s Assessment 1 and started adapting the changes required for the deliverables which includes Risk assessment, requirements and MS&P. Implementing the website was started and organisation and restructure of the root directories were done.

  desc: Most of the changes we started adapting into the deliverables were finished this week and were waiting review. We implemented the box2d collision code and finished the scenario mode. This was followed by work being started on the endless mode of the game. Testing continued to be worked on by assigned team members. We brainstormed ideas for power ups and decided on a few. A decision was made to change the meeting structure which was also done. The Java Continuous Integration Pipeline had to be formatted. We introduced Jekyll to generate the website layout and design during this week. 
- img: Week7.png
  desc: We improved some parts of the risk assessment deliverable. The work on the website with Jekyll continued into this week and was finally finished. We made plans for the month-long break ahead and planned how the team would function during Easter. The code for endless mode was made ready for review as well. We discussed how the power up system would work and created a money system.

  desc: During the second week into the holidays the group went through a bit of a cold period and not a lot of work was done. Some team members worked testing but did not necessarily make a lot of progress. 
- img: Week9.png
  desc: While some light work on testing and implementation continued this week carried onto the first of the 2 week long easter holiday that we did not necessarily make a lot of progress during. 
- img: Week9.png
  desc: No work or meetings were hosted during the week because of Easter.
- img: Week11.png
  desc: New plans were made on the last push to the submission on May 3rd. Testing continued and Stations and power up implementations were worked on this week. This involved greying out the stations if not unlocked yet and walking up to it interact and this creates a button to appear with the option to unlock. We discussed the idea of always having a button on screen that causes a popup  to appear on screen with clickable images with power ups and unlockable cooks. A new money system was added to the game with customers giving you a tip the faster you serve them. 
- img: Week12.png
  desc: We created the report for the Continuous Integration Pipeline this week. The weekly snaps were also created this week and we added the notes (this document) which involved a small description of what went on during each week of the assessment period. We assigned team members on new deliverables and finalised and prepared for the submission.
- img: Week13.png
  desc: Some implementations of power ups, UI and customers and work on deliverables and finalising were done. The testing report, Continuous Integration report, architecture was finalised. The website was completed, and we finished up testing and tried to get a maximum possible line and class coverage. And finally on the 3rd of May we logged into teaching.cs.york.ac.uk and submitted our project and relevant links.
